          <p>
              My Name Is Joseph And I Love A-Lot Of Shit, Physical Media, Music, You Name It, I Got Tired Of AI Slop on the Internet And Social Media 
             In General So I Decided To Make My Own Website And Have Fun With It, Will Be Uploading EveryDay, Hopefully My Life Interests You, Or Not
             Who Knows What Will Happen, For Feedback Or you wanna just say hi, my email is: josephshipley2004@gmail.com, i do reply but not instantly
             So Keep That In Mind 
 
             </p>
             <h2>What Made Me Start A Website?</h2>
             <p>

                I Always Wanted Something To My Name, And My Own Personal Corner On The Internet, I Said, Why Not Right?, So I Decided To Make My Own
                I Love It So Far, I Wanna try Updating This Website Every Month Or So With Something New, Maybe A Flash Game, Music, Who Knows?,
                Also I Stopped Using Website Builders, I Would Rather Take The Time To Code And Learn It, Plus They Are Too Expensive
